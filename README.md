# Bot-tleship
Final Project for CS-2322 Artificial Intelligence: Bot for playing Battleship

We implement three bots along with accompanying wrappers. Bots can be tested using the ```test_bot``` function in helpers.py or the ```play_bots``` function in test_bots.py.

The three bots use the following methods:

- Monte Carlo Tree Search

- Deep Q Network

- Proximal Policy Optimization
